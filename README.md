# SGD_Project

## What are the Sustainable Development Goals ?
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 global goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015. The goals aim to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure peace and prosperity for all people by 2030. The SDGs address a range of social and environmental issues, including education, climate change, economic inequality, and more. They are designed to be a blueprint for global development and to help countries around the world achieve sustainable development.

## Why work on this subject ?
As I strive to enhance my Data Engineering abilities, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide an excellent framework for me to learn and apply various technical architectures and methodologies for each of the 17 goals. Through the lens of the SDGs, I can explore the challenges facing our world and create insightful data visualizations to better understand these issues.

## How will I work on these goals ? 
Each goal are more precisely defined by "Targets and Indicators" that we can find on the main website of the United Nations.
For example, the two first targets and indicators for the 1st goal are the following one : 

![example_target_indicator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63043011/207667235-9c3e837b-c67e-4fba-b83b-7600dcd5fa98.jpg)

I can then take for support these different indicators to try to evaluate their state with data vizualisation.

## Main methodology

For each of the goals, I'll apply the following methodology :
1. Explain the goal and define clearly all its targets and indicators,
2. Find and extract different data sources to understand better the evolution of each indicators,
3. Build Data Pipeline,
   1. Implement data ingestion (Data Lake / Data Warehouse / ...)
   2. Build data processing (ETL / ELT / ...)
   3. Implement data serving (Data Warehouse)
4. Build vizualisation 
5. (Optional) Build Workflow scheduling system
6. (Optional) Monitor data pipeline (logs, metadata, metrics, performance, ...)
7. (Optional) Add data security and privacy

## Technical Tools

My main goal with this project is being able to work and be comfortable with multiple tools and strategies related to data engineering!

Here are the following tools that I intend to use :
* <ins>Programming language :</ins> Python, SQL, Scala
* <ins>Relational Databases :</ins> PostgreSQL, MySQL
* <ins>Non-Relational Databases :</ins> MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, Neo4j, Redis
* <ins>Data Warehouse / Lake :</ins> SnowFlake, Apache Hive
* <ins>Cluster Computing :</ins> Apache Hadoop, HDFS, MapReduce
* <ins>Data Processing :</ins> Apache Spark, Apache Pig, Apache Flink, Apache Kafka
* <ins>ETL :</ins> Talend, Pentaho
* <ins>Workflow Scheduling :</ins> Apache Airflow, Luigi
* <ins>Data Vizualisation :</ins> Tableau, Grafana, Power BI

I'll also try to complete **Cloud Solutions** (with my budget limit) by using... 
* <ins>AWS :</ins> Aurora, DynamoDB, S3, Redshfit, EMR, Glue, Quicksight
* <ins>Microsoft Azure :</ins> CosmosDB, Synapse, BlobStorage, Data Lake
* <ins>GCP :</ins> Bigtable, BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Dataproc, Data Fusion, Composer
