## What are the Sustainable Development Goals ?
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 global goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015. The goals aim to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure peace and prosperity for all people by 2030. The SDGs address a range of social and environmental issues, including education, climate change, economic inequality, and more. They are designed to be a blueprint for global development and to help countries around the world achieve sustainable development.

## Why work on this subject ?
As I strive to enhance my Data Engineering abilities, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide an excellent framework for me to learn and apply various technical architectures and methodologies for each of the 17 goals. Through the lens of the SDGs, I can explore the challenges facing our world and create insightful data visualizations to better understand these issues.

## How will I work on these goals ? 
Each goal are more precisely defined by "Targets and Indicators" that we can find on the main website of the United Nations.
For example, the two first targets and indicators for the 1st goal are the following one : 
IMAGE TARGETS AND INDICATORS

For each of the goals, I'll apply the following methodology :
1. Explain the goal and define clearly all his targets and indicators
2. Find and extract different data source to respond to 
3. Build Data Pipeline
   1. Implement Data Entry management (Data Lake / Data Warehouse / ...)
   2. Build data processing (ETL / ELT / ...)
   3. Implement data output management (Data Warehouse)
4. Build Data Vizualisation tool
